 Pet ownership has grown significantly, with many people looking for efficient ways to care
 for their pets. Currently, adopting pets,
 buying trusted products, and accessing veterinary services require using multiple platforms,
 which can be time-consuming and fragmented.
 This project proposes a single platform, Petব , where users can easily adopt pets and access
 essential products and medical services all in one place.
 Petব aims to create a comprehensive environment to support both new and experienced
 pet owners, making pet adoption and care easier and more effective
